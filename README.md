# Group3_FinalProject

## Segement 1 Selected Topic - NFL Combine Draft 2009 - 2019

* Purpose - The purpose of this project is to analyze data from the NFL Combine Draft dataset using tools to identify corrilations between datapoints and predict if a football player who attends the NFL Combine will be drafted on undrafted with 75% accruacy.
  
* Question(s) - How do different combine stats effect wheather a player is drafted or undrafted?

### Technology Used
* Languages: `Python`
* Technologies: `Postgres`, `AWS`, `PostgresLite`
* Tools: Machine Learning models from `SciKitLearn` and `Imbalanced` learn, Dashabord templates possibly from `Tablau Stories`, etc.

### Data Source
The dataset contains stats and information form the NFL Combine (2009 to 2019), inclduing the results from sports performance tests and draft outcomes.

## Analytic Dashboard
Using a data visualizatin tool such as Tablau Stories, Ddataframes will be collected from the exploritory development and implamneted into User Interactive charts within Stories. Custom images, cover pages, and colors will be chosen by the team.
* What position type or player types is most represented at the NFL Combine? [Pie Chart visualization of DF]
* What are the average stats of offence vs defence? [Stacked bar chart of DF]
* What relationships do the Clusters containe from the Machine Learning model? [Cluster or DF]
