## Analytic Dashboard Using Tableau Public
Using the data visualizatin tool Tablau Public, the NFL_Clean_Up.csv file will be uploaded for dashbaord creation. [update] User Interactive charts within Tableau. A single dashboard will combine all charts with an interactivty component. Any additional images relevent to exploritory findinds, database tables, and machine models will be added to the presentation slides unless there is a way to add those images to the dashboard.

### Charts
* What position type or player type is most represented at the NFL Combine? [Pie chart visualization of DF]
* What are the average stats of offence vs defence? [Stacked bar chart of DF]
* What relationships do the Clusters containe from the Machine Learning model? [Cluster of DF]

### Tableau Dashboard
Trial Dashboard findings
* Player and Position type seem to display the most complete charts, however the differences in values are minimal. Will try to activate the filter function for Undrafted and Drafted dimensions as the main UI.
* Still researching how to display a cluster chart from the machine model
