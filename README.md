# Group3_FinalProject


## Selected Topic â€“ NFL Combine Performance (2009-2019)

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from the NFL Combine dataset using tools to identify correlations between performance datapoints and to predict if a football player who attends the NFL Combine will be drafted or undrafted with 75% accuracy.

Questions:
* Primary:
    * Using a machine learning model, can we predict if a player who attends the NFL Combine will be drafted or undrafted with 75% accuracy?

* Secondary:
    * Using the Random Forest model, can we see how position groups differ?
    * Can we find any meaningful cluster groups using unsupervised machine learning?
    * What position types and player types are most represented at the NFL combine?
    * What are the average statistics by player type (offense, defense, and special teams)?

## Data Exploration and Processing
Description
1. Creating a dataframe that show all the combine attendees and the school they attended to show the number of schools who had players attend the combine and also show which schools had the most attendants.
2. There are seven different position groupings in the dataframe. Creating a dataframe for each position to show event stats for those drafted and another data frame for those undrafted will allow the ability to show how those who were drafted preformed to those undrafted in each event.
3. Being able to see each player, their event statistics, and where they were drafted, may shed insight to see if better event stats relates to being drafted higher instead of just team need. 
4. Create dataframes of a few teams to see how many draft picks they had from 2009 - 2019
5. View players physical characteristics such as height, weight, BMI, and age in relation to what overall pick they were taken.
