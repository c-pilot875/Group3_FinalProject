### Tableau Dashboard
Trial Dashboard findings
* Player and Position type seem to display the most complete charts, however the differences in values are minimal. Will try to activate the filter function for Undrafted and Drafted dimensions as the main UI.
* Still researching how to display a cluster chart from the machine model
* Any residual visualizations from the exploitory analysis, database build, and machine model will be displayed under "Results" of the Slide Presentation.
